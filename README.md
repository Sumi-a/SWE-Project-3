# CS 230 Final Project 
# Review App: Movies, TV Shows, Books

## Overview
The Review App is a versatile project designed to manage and review content across three categories: movies, books, and TV shows. Built with a modular structure, it allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each category while enabling the addition and management of reviews. The backend is powered by Flask, providing a RESTful API for seamless communication between the user interface and the database, which is managed using SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval. The frontend is deployed through Gradio, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface. With robust API endpoints, users can search for movies, books, or TV shows by genre or ID, making it a scalable and functional solution for content and review management. The project also incorporates automated unit testing using Pythonâ€™s Unittest framework to ensure reliability and performance.
